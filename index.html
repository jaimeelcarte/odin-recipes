      <h1>Welcome to The Odin Project recipes!</h1>
      <p>This is a demo website created to showcase my skills as a full stack developer. While you’ll find recipe examples and a clean, user-friendly design here, please note that this is not a real cooking website – it’s purely for demonstration purposes.</p>
      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Purpose: This website was built to highlight my expertise in web development, including frontend design, backend integration, and database management.</li>
          <li>Features: The site includes a basic recipe browsing experience, a search function, and a responsive design suitable for all devices.</li>
          <li>Technology Stack: Developed using HTML & CSS.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Explore the demo</h2>
      <p>Feel free to explore the pages, click on recipes, and see how the interface works. The content and recipes are placeholders, but the design and functionality reflect the quality of work I can deliver.</p>
      <p><strong>Thank you for visiting!</strong></p>
