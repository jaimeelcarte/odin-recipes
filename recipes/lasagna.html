      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Meat lasagna is a classic Italian recipe that we have been adapting to
        our homes as we have become more familiar with it and its recipes.
        Making a tasty meat lasagna is very easy, even using the Thermomix, with
        which we can make the béchamel sauce or the filling itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we are going to bring you our version, which we believe is
        <b>the best meat lasagna</b> in terms of time spent, and you will see
        that the filling with this tomato sauce with the meat and vegetables is
        very worthwhile - so much so that you would eat it by the spoonful - and
        for which you can even use a stewed meat that you have already made.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not like beef or this mix, you can also make a chicken
        lasagna, boletus or tuna lasagna or make it lighter by
        <b>interspersing layers of vegetables</b>, for example eggplant or
        zucchini, as if it were a moussaka.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this filling you can even use a bolognese sauce that you had frozen
        and you had left over, because it is one of the best fillings, or if you
        do not like the format of the lasagna, bet on a cannelloni, which are
        <b>still the same sheets of pasta</b> but arranged in tubes instead of
        flat layers.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div class="list">
        <ol class="steps">
          <li>
            Put olive oil in a large casserole or low frying pan. Sauté the
            onion, the bell pepper and the carrots, previously cleaned and
            chopped, until they take color. When they are almost ready, add the
            zucchini in small pieces and the garlic cloves and sauté the whole.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the bacon and the chopped mushrooms, let them cook and add the
            minced meat, using a fork to break up the possible balls that
            sometimes form when the meat cakes together.
            <b>Let it just take color</b>, add the wine, turn up the heat and
            wait for it to evaporate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover with the tomato sauce, add salt, oregano and basil to taste,
            and
            <b>let it reduce stirring from time to time</b> over very low heat.
            Meanwhile we make the béchamel sauce by putting the butter in a
            saucepan, when it is melted we add the flour and turn it a few times
            to toast. Pour the hot milk little by little, and stirring
            constantly, cook for about 10 minutes until it thickens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Season with salt and pepper and add nutmeg to taste</b>. To
            assemble the lasagna, place at the bottom of an ovenproof dish a
            little tomato sauce or bechamel sauce, on top a plate of lasagna
            pasta, previously cooked in salted water, a little bechamel sauce,
            and filling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the same operation until almost reaching the edge of the
            dish. Finish with a plate of pasta that we
            <b>cover with bechamel sauce</b> and sprinkle with grated cheese to
            gratinate. Bake for 30 minutes and gratinate for two minutes. Serve
            immediately very hot.
