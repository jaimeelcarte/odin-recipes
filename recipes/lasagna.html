    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Meat lasagna is a classic Italian recipe that we have been adapting to our
      homes as we have become more familiar with it and its recipes. Making a
      tasty meat lasagna is very easy, even using the Thermomix, with which we
      can make the béchamel sauce or the filling itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today we are going to bring you our version, which we believe is
      <strong>the best meat lasagna</strong> in terms of time spent, and you
      will see that the filling with this tomato sauce with the meat and
      vegetables is very worthwhile - so much so that you would eat it by the
      spoonful - and for which you can even use a stewed meat that you have
      already made.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not like beef or this mix, you can also make a chicken lasagna,
      boletus or tuna lasagna or make it lighter by
      <strong>interspersing layers of vegetables</strong>, for example eggplant
      or zucchini, as if it were a moussaka.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this filling you can even use a bolognese sauce that you had frozen
      and you had left over, because it is one of the best fillings, or if you
      do not like the format of the lasagna, bet on a cannelloni, which are
      <strong>still the same sheets of pasta</strong> but arranged in tubes
      instead of flat layers.

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>4 servings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>300 g Minced veal</li>
      <li>200 g Minced pork</li>
      <li>2 Sliced bacon</li>
      <li>2 Carrot</li>
      <li>1 Green bell pepper</li>
      <li>1 Onion</li>
      <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
      <li>150 g Mushroom</li>
      <li>0.5 Zucchini</li>
      <li>50 ml Red wine</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Basil</li>
      <li>Dried oregano</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Lasagna pasta sheets</li>
      <li>Grated cheese</li>
      <li>600 ml Whole milk</li>
      <li>60 g Wheat flour</li>
      <li>30 g Butter</li>
      <li>Ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put olive oil in a large casserole or low frying pan. Sauté the onion,
        the bell pepper and the carrots, previously cleaned and chopped, until
        they take color. When they are almost ready, add the zucchini in small
        pieces and the garlic cloves and sauté the whole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the bacon and the chopped mushrooms, let them cook and add the
        minced meat, using a fork to break up the possible balls that sometimes
        form when the meat cakes together.
        <strong>Let it just take color</strong>, add the wine, turn up the heat
        and wait for it to evaporate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with the tomato sauce, add salt, oregano and basil to taste, and
        <strong>let it reduce stirring from time to time</strong> over very low
        heat. Meanwhile we make the béchamel sauce by putting the butter in a
        saucepan, when it is melted we add the flour and turn it a few times to
        toast. Pour the hot milk little by little, and stirring constantly, cook
        for about 10 minutes until it thickens.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season with salt and pepper and add nutmeg to taste</strong>. To
        assemble the lasagna, place at the bottom of an ovenproof dish a little
        tomato sauce or bechamel sauce, on top a plate of lasagna pasta,
        previously cooked in salted water, a little bechamel sauce, and filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the same operation until almost reaching the edge of the dish.
        Finish with a plate of pasta that we
        <strong>cover with bechamel sauce</strong> and sprinkle with grated
        cheese to gratinate. Bake for 30 minutes and gratinate for two minutes.
        Serve immediately very hot.
