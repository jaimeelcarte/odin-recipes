      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Curry recipes have long ceased to be something exotic on our tables, and
        I'm glad, because although they are not faithfully traditional
        elaborations of Indian cuisine, they allow us to prepare delicious meals
        with very little time. With this<b>chicken curry recipe in 10 minutes</b
        >we have a complete and tasty dish ready in a jiffy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important thing to be fast and efficient in the kitchen is<b
          >preparation and order</b
        >,so make sure you have all the utensils and ingredients ready before
        you start cooking, so you can also make a side dish of curry rice or
        whatever you like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Cutting the chicken</b>into small pieces and with the products at
        room temperature we will cook much faster. Use the mixture of spices
        that you like, even a homemade garam masala. When you master this
        recipe, you will be able to make other more complex Indian dishes such
        as the mythical butter chicken curry.

            finely chop the garlic clove, the ginger and the chilli without the
            seeds, if used. If we use frozen chopped onion we will save even
            more time.
