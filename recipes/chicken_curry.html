    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Curry recipes have long ceased to be something exotic on our tables, and
      I'm glad, because although they are not faithfully traditional
      elaborations of Indian cuisine, they allow us to prepare delicious meals
      with very little time. With this
      <strong>chicken curry recipe in 10 minutes</strong> we have a complete and
      tasty dish ready in a jiffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important thing to be fast and efficient in the kitchen is
      <strong>preparation and order</strong>, so make sure you have all the
      utensils and ingredients ready before you start cooking, so you can also
      make a side dish of curry rice or whatever you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cutting the chicken</strong> into small pieces and with the
      products at room temperature we will cook much faster. Use the mixture of
      spices that you like, even a homemade garam masala. When you master this
      recipe, you will be able to make other more complex Indian dishes such as
      the mythical butter chicken curry.

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>2 servings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 chicken breast</li>
      <li>1 spring onion</li>
      <li>1 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>5g fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 small chili pepper</li>
      <li>5g ground curry</li>
      <li>2g ground turmeric</li>
      <li>2g ground cumin</li>
      <li>2g ground cumin</li>
      <li>45ml crushed tomato</li>
      <li>2g salt</li>
      <li>ground black pepper</li>
      <li>200ml coconut milk</li>
      <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>fresh coriander or parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The first thing to do is to have all the ingredients ready. Cut the
        chicken into <strong>bite-size pieces</strong>. Chop the spring onion
        and finely chop the garlic clove, the ginger and the chilli without the
        seeds, if used. If we use frozen chopped onion we will save even more
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a little oil in a frying pan or casserole and fry the spring onion
        for 2 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and chilli, stir a few times and
        add the tomato. After 1 minute, <strong>add all the spices</strong> and
        stir well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken, season with salt and pepper and mix.
        <strong>Cook over high heat</strong> for a few minutes, until golden
        brown on all sides. Cover with coconut milk or cream and allow to reduce
        slightly. Serve with chopped fresh parsley or cilantro.
