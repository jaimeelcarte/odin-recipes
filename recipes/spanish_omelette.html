      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        It is customary in many cities to celebrate the day of their patron
        saint with a picnic. In Madrid, on the day of San Isidro, people usually
        go to the meadow named after the saint and have a picnic lunch of
        breaded steaks, fried green peppers and above all the classic potato
        omelet. To make something special I have prepared a
        <strong
          >potato omelette with confit potatoes and caramelized onion</strong
        >
        for San Isidro's day, looking for an intense flavor and a particularly
        creamy texture.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish off the process, if you go to the verbena you can prepare or
        buy some rosquillas de San Isidro, the "tontas" or the "listas",
        depending on whether you want them with or without a sugar bath and top
        it off with some sugar and brandy. Of course, if you prepare this
        tortilla, wherever you are from,
        <strong>you will never forget its flavor</strong> in your life.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>4 servings:</p>
      <div class="list">
        <ul class="ingredients">
          <li>5 Onions</li>
          <li>5 Potatoes</li>
          <li>6 Eggs</li>
          <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div class="steps">
        <ol>
          <li>
            To make the recipe there are two tasks: on the one hand to confit
            the onion <strong>in its own sugars</strong>, over very low heat and
            without adding sugar or Modena vinegar, soy sauce or any other
            ingredient. On the other hand, confit the potatoes by frying them at
            low temperature so that they are really tender.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To confit the onion</strong>, chop it into julienne strips
            and put it over low heat in a large frying pan with plenty of olive
            oil. Add a pinch of salt and let it cook slowly. During the first
            few minutes we will be stirring a lot so that the onion strands are
            cooked equally.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the volume of the onion decreases, we can remove part of the
            oil and let the onion cook until it is
            <strong>reduced to a volume similar to that of a tangerine</strong>.
            Imagine how much it has to be reduced. The process, stirring from
            time to time, takes about 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            During this time, peel the potatoes and cut them into thin slices.
            As we are also going to confit them, we put a frying pan with a lot
            of oil and add the potatoes to the oil before turning on the fire.
            When they
            <strong>start frying from the cold oil</strong>, they will be super
            tender. Then we fry them slowly, without cooking the oil at any
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the potatoes are ready, beat the eggs in a bowl, add the
            well-drained potatoes and add the caramelized onion on top. Mix the
            ingredients well and cook the omelet to your liking. I
            <strong>usually prefer them juicy</strong> to eat at home but when
            they are to eat out like today, we curdle them a little more for
            safety.
